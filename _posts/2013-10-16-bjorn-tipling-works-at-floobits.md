[Bjorn Tipling](https://github.com/btipling) is talented, intelligent, and driven. In addition to his thorough knowledge of JavaScript and CSS, he has an eye for design and usability. Most importantly, he's a pleasant person to work with. He'd never tell you all that, of course. He's too humble to brag about himself.

Bjorn and I have known each other for the better part of a decade. We were on the [Bloglines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines) team at Ask.com. We were at [Cloudkick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudkick). We were at [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/). Now we're at Floobits.

In short: Bjorn's awesome. Matt and I are so happy he decided to join us.
