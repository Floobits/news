[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is my editor of choice. It's powerful, flexible, and accessible. But as much as I like it, Sublime Text does have one glaring problem: its plugin API is Python... sort of. That "sort of" is the cause of much frustration and annoyance.

> "Sort of" is such a harmless thing to say... sort of. It's just a filler. Sort of... it doesn't really mean anything. But after certain things, sort of means everything. Like... after "I love you"... or "You're going to live."

â€” [Demetri Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetri_Martin)


For most people most of the time, writing Sublime Text plugins is scarcely different from writing normal Python. Just import some modules, define some [Sublime commands](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html#sublime_plugin.ApplicationCommand), and you're golden. At Floobits, we learned the hard way that this isn't always the case. We spent months working on our Sublime Text plugin. After extensive development and testing, we finally judged our work ready. We released it to the world... only to suffer a deluge of complaints. Many on Windows and Linux couldn't use our plugin. Merely activating our plugin raised exceptions on their systems.

This confused us. Sublime Text's plugin API is Python. Though we develop on Macs, the code should work fine everywhere. Except for a few well-documented edge cases, Python works the same on Windows, OS X, and Linux.

That's true for Python, but not for Sublime Text's Python. The Python that ships with Sublime Text varies significantly in its capabilities. On some platforms and Sublime Text verisons, standard Python modules are broken. You can verify this yourself. If you open Sublime Text 2 on Windows and run `import select` in the consoley you'll see:

Or if you're on Linux, open Sublime Text 2 and try to `import ssl`:

<img src="/images/st2_linux_ssl.png" />

For Floobits, these errors are deal-breakers. Our plugins need `select()` for asynchronous network I/O. We need Python's `ssl` module because our network protocol always uses encryption. For our purposes, these modules have no alternatives or substitutes. At the time, this realization was extremely disheartening. We wracked our brains to come up with solutions. It took a while, but we succeeded.

The key insight was simple: while Sublime's Python might lack `ssl`, the operating system's Python should be fine. If we could hand the encryption work off to the OS's Python, we'd be in business. Once we knew what to do, [our solution](https://github.com/Floobits/floobits-sublime/pull/144) took only a week to code.


[I reported the `import ssl` issue](https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/177) almost two years ago, but it still hasn't been fixed. At this point, I doubt it ever will be.
