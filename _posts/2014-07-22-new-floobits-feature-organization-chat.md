We use Floobits to develop Floobits, so we encounter many of the same pain points as our users. One problem we had was chat. Often, we wanted to be able to communicate without necessarily working on the same code. In an office, you can tell when someone doesn't want to be interrupted.  walk up to someone and ask for help or information.  we used a special workspace for chatting (both text and video). It was also handy to keep notes in that workspace. Still, the experience was definitely sub-optimal.
