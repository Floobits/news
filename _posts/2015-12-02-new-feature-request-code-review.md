If you use our web-based editor, you may have noticed a button in the upper-right with the label, "Request Code Review."

The button does exactly what it says. If you click on it and give us a short description of what you want reviewed, we'll get back to you with an estimate. We can even schedule a time to video chat or pair program with you.

Now, we're bringing this feature to our editor plugins. If you use Atom, IntelliJ, or Sublime Text, you can request code reviews. If you're connected to a workspace, this option is available in each editor's command palette.
