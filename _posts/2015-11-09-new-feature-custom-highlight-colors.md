If you use Floobits with IntelliJ, Atom, or our web editor, you've probably noticed that users' selections have have different colors. You might also have noticed that these colors can't be changed. If you get unlucky, your colleagues might have the same color. Then it's hard to tell who is editing what.

Well, good news! We've updated our plugins and our site to allow each users to change their highlight color. If you're not satisfied with your default color, just go to [your user settings](https://floobits.com/dash/settings#user) and select a new color from the drop-down. I'm a fan of lime.

Users occasionally asked us for this feature, but we didn't deem it high priority until one organization was unlucky enough to have *three* of their devs stuck with the same color. Oops. At least it won't be a problem anymore. Sorry.

Again, be sure to update your plugins! If you don't, you'll still see old the colors based on each username.

Lastly, we love feedback from users. If you have any Floobits-related comments or suggestions, don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:info@floobits.com).
