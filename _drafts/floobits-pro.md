# Introducing Floobits Pro


Geoff, Matt and I are proud to announce a huge new feature for Floobits: Floobits Pro! Floobits Pro allows you to hire people to help you out on your project. If you have a tough problem to solve and you think you could use the help of another set of eyes, or maybe you just want a code review, try out Floobits Pro.

We have built a sophisticated user interface to make it easy to hire people and automatically invite them into your private workspace, temporarily giving the pro you’ve hired edit access to your files. The process begins by clicking a button at the top of your screen and describing your problem. If someone is available a Pro may bid to work on your problem. You will be able to see the feedback the Pro received for previous work, a description and the technology they are familiar with. You will also be able to chat with the person before you hire them to make sure you are making the right choice.

Once you have hired a Pro you have up to five minutes to cancel the session without incurring any cost. The Pro will join your workspace and be ready to help you with your problem. You will be able to use all the tools that make Floobits so great. You can work from your favorite editor, use WebRTC video chat or Google Hangouts. 

We are also giving all of our existing paid Floobits subscriber an hour free help! 

Signing up is easy, simply go to our special sign up form for people who need help, provide us with billing information (you will not be charged until you have completed a session that lasted more than five minutes), and describe your problem. We will create a special workspace where you can add files. If you are already familiar with Floobits you can upload your project or get help on an existing project that you have already shared on Floobits.

If you would like to sign up to help others, we have a from for that too. We would like to hear from you.

We are very excited about this new feature and hope you give it a try. If you have any comments or suggestions please do not hesitate to contact us.
