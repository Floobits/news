Today, we are proud to introduce [Floobits Pro](). Floobits Pro lets you to hire other developers to help you out on your project. Whether you just need another pair of eyes to double-check a function, or an expert to track down a race condition, we've got you covered.

Signing up is easy. Go to our [sign up form](/signup/pro/client), provide us with your billing information (you will not be charged until you complete a session), and tell us what you need. We'll create a workspace for you where you can add files and collaborate. If you already have a Floobits account, you can click on the "Floobits Pro" button in existing workspaces.

Once you request help, we'll alert the Pros who in turn choose to work with you.  We provide you with a description of the technology they are familiar with, their feedback from previous sessions, and give you the option to chat before you make your decision of who to hire.

After you pick a Pro, they'll immediately join your workspace and be ready to help. You can use all the tools that make Floobits great: work in your native editor, share terminals, and video chat using WebRTC or Google Hangouts. If for some reason it doesn't work out, don't worry. Cancel the session in the first five minutes and you won't pay anything.

We are very excited about Pro and hope you'll give it a try. If you have any comments or suggestions, don't hesitate to [contact us](). If you are interested in becoming a Pro, [apply here](/signup/pro).

One more thing: We're giving all of our paying users an hour of free help. That's right, if you're on a paid plan, we'll help you with your code for free! Think of it as a thank-you for your support.
